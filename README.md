## Requirements
* Have EchoVR installed and at least opened once without the assistance of this application
* Have EchoVR files under the Oculus Directory(Regardless of where the Oculus directory is)
  * Expect to have this limitation fixed in a later update


## Installation of the repository


## Usage


### Setup the Echo Protocol
    
      The web launcher will not work if these steps are not completed
     1. Download the latest release
     2. Unzip the release anywhere(but I highly recommend the desktop)
     3. Run RegisterEchoProtocol.exe as ADIMINISTRATOR

### To create a public game
Verify that you're in a private game
##### Method 1
* Visit [THIS](http://echovrprotocol.com/createPubGame) link and click on the "Initialize Live Public Game" button
* This will create a public listing on the Echo Scrim Organizer lfg-bot text channel(ability to choose individual servers coming in a later update)

##### Method 2
* Double Click on GameInviter.exe when you're in a private echo arena game
     * this will fill your clipboard with a command for discord
* Paste(CRTL-V) the command in any channel within Echo Scrim Organizer, AND type public
* If you want to set up live stats for the public listings, follow method 1, it will not replace your current listing

### To create a "private" private game
